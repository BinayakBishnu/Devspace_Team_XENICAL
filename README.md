# Track: Healthcare and Social Responsibility

## Problem Statement: Suggest solutions that would help increase women safety in high risk areas

A guide made for women to take precautions or defend themselves in high risk areas. We have provided links to self-defence videos and information on unsafe areas.

The advantage of our website is that all information is in one place along with valuable resources for easy and quick access.

We have created a home page which links to other webpages made by us on self-defence, safety measures and information on crime rates in cities.
